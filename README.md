# Description

Fully Booked is a web application that allows users to keep track of books they have read, want to read, or are currently reading. Users can easily add and remove in their virtual bookshelf. The app is responsively designed for both desktop and mobile devices and also includes a dark mode feature for a visually appealing experience. It was built as a homework project from The Odin Project, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS as technologies.
